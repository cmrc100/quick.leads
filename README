quick.leads

Mobile Event Lead App for Force.com

Typically collecting a lead from an event, converence, or expo is simply scanning a badge which gets stuck in a list of hundreds of leads without any context as to the nature of the converstaion.

Event lead uses Salesforce Campaigns to create a set of offers that can record the specific interest or product that a customer inquired about.

The event is represented by a top level campaign of type Seminar/Conference that is Active and with a Status of "In Progress"

Child campaigns (with Status of "In Progress") in the campaign hierarchy represent the individual offers or topics that you are tracking for the event.

Bugs
- Need to reconcile that Lead can only be a CampaignMember of a give campaign once. No duplicates allowed. My bandaid is to just get out on error, but I need to put some proper error checking all over, and see about some kind of validation where if someone is a lead attached to one of the campaigns we show it or prevent that route. 

Wish list:
- Embed external content, video embed in in View Offer page
- Event-specific branding (beyond just an image)
- Mobile analytics for campaign results and lead gen statistics

Personal TODO's:
- clean up TODO's
- test deploy to Event Org
- Compile list of declarative stuff (workflows and such)

Technical Notes: 
quick.leads is an HTML5 application built on the Force.com platform using Visualforce with AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap. The back end is comprised entirely of Standard Salesforce.com CRM objects and so requires a full Salesforce license.
