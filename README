Mobile Event Lead App for Force.com

Typically collecting a lead from an event, converence, or expo is simply scanning a badge which gets stuck in a list of hundreds of leads without any context as to the nature of the converstaion.

Event lead uses Salesforce Campaigns to create a set of offers that can record the specific interest or product that a customer inquired about.

The event is represented by a top level campaign of type Seminar/Conference that is Active and with a Status of "In Progress"

Child campaigns (with Status of "In Progress") in the campaign hierarchy represent the individual offers or topics that you are tracking for the event.

Bugs
- Need to reconcile that Lead can only be a CampaignMember of a give campaign once. No duplicates allowed. My bandaid is to just get out on error, but I need to put some proper error checking all over, and see about some kind of validation where if someone is a lead attached to one of the campaigns we show it or prevent that route.

Wish list:
- Embed video content in in View Offer page
- Event-specific branding (beyond just an image)
- Mobile analytics for campaign results and lead gen statistics
