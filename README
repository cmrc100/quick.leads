Mobile Event Lead App for Force.com

Typically collecting a lead from an event, conference, or expo is simply scanning a badge which gets stuck in a list of hundreds of leads without any context as to the nature of the converstaion.

quick.leads uses Salesforce Campaigns to create a set of offers that can record the specific interest or product that a customer inquired about.

The event is represented by a top level campaign of type Seminar/Conference, Conference, or Trade Show and with a Status of "In Progress"

Child campaigns (with Status of "In Progress") in the campaign hierarchy represent the individual offers or topics that you are tracking for the event.

To enhance the app, you could plug in declarative features such as Lead assignment rules, workflow email rules and email templates on CampaignMember. 

Bugs
- Need to reconcile that Lead can only be a CampaignMember of a give campaign once. No duplicates allowed. My bandaid is to just get out on error, but I need to put some proper error checking all over, and see about some kind of validation where if someone is a lead attached to one of the campaigns we show it or prevent that route. 
- Some orgs do not resolve VF pages to the c.xxx.visual.force.com host name which breaks the current angular-force.js visualforce detection feature. Plan to fix in early august.

Wish list:
- Better leveraging of AngularJS architecture by reducing searches and moving more cached data into the model.
	- Loading Events once and using an Angular Filter on Home page
	- Loading top level campaign members on Contact page and using Angular Filter for search
	- Caching offers and not requerying except when selecting Event again. 
- Better UX around in progress page loads, searches, AJAX calls, etc. I was grossly negligent in this regard and I'm sure it will be easy to do with either some built-in Angular or Bootstrap features. 
- To be able to embed external content on offer presentation page or description, video embed in in View Offer page
- Event-specific branding (beyond just an image)
- Mobile analytics for campaign results and lead gen statistics
- Visualforce tool to take a list of contacts and associate them with the parent campaign as Leads
- Utilize contacts for Event campaign members, would require selection or creation of Account. Contacts without Accounts don't get treated the same during Lead conversion deduping, etc.

NOTES: 
- The permission set for the unmanaged package is currently untested. 
- Running in the Visualforce Inline Page Editor interferes with AngularJS and the app will not function correctly.

Technical Notes: 
quick.leads is an HTML5 application built on the Force.com platform using Visualforce with AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap. The back end is comprised entirely of Standard Salesforce.com CRM objects and so requires a full Salesforce license.
